## About me
### Languages
The languages I am most familiar with are `C#` and `javascript`.  
I've also had the chance to use, very briefly, `PHP` for web projects.

### Frameworks & Softwares
#### React & Next
I've been using React.js for a few years and just started to deep into Next.js for SSR. 

#### Unity
I've also developed a small game with Unity that you can check out here.

#### Bootstrap
Although I haven't used Bootstrap for my portfolio, I have used it daily for at least 2 years, with or without SCSS.
